"""
Unified dependency file (informational).

The project has two Python components that may run on different machines:
1. Kali API Server (kali-server/) -> use requirements.kali.txt
2. MCP Server (mcp-server/)       -> use requirements.mcp.txt

Install separately:
	pip install -r requirements.kali.txt   # On the Kali machine
	pip install -r requirements.mcp.txt    # On the MCP client machine

System packages (install via apt on Kali):
	nmap gobuster dirb nikto hydra sqlmap wpscan john enum4linux metasploit-framework sshpass docker.io

This file is kept to document the split. It intentionally lists no direct packages.
